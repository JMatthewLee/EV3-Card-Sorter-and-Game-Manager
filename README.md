<h4>EV3 - Dutch Blitz Card Sorter Robot</h4>
<p>
Dutch Blitz is a card game involving 4 players with differently coloured decks. After each round, the decks become mixed together and need to be sorted for the next round to be played and score must be calculated. This detracts from the actual gameplay and is generally unfun, so the goal of this project is to design a Lego EV3 robot that can automate the sorting and scoring process of Dutch Blitz.
